            <h2>Coding Interest</h2>
            <p>The problem solving aspect of Coding is what really draws me in. Being able to build programs to solve tasks and then collaborate with others and create new solutions together allows us to make some really exciting projects. For now I just make simple applications and games in canvas but I would like to get a full time developing position and maybe one day make bigger games! </p>

            <h2>Otherwise</h2>
            <p>In my free time I'm mostly at the gym, training Jiu Jitsu, Muay Thai, Kickboxing and Wrestling or lifting weights. When I get home I usually get into some gaming with friends or by myself.</p>
